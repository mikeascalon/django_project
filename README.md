Project: Django Custom User

Author: Michelangelo Ascalon

## Overview

Django does a great job at allowing to get started with a solid foundation. But a foundation is just the beginning. We still need to â€œbuild the house.


### Setup

Install dependencies:

```gitbash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

PORT - [Port Number](http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

##### How to Run

To initialize and run the application, execute the following command:

```gitbash
python manage.py runserver
```

This will start the Django development server, allowing you to access the application at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ (or the specified port).
